# Code Review Project
This repository holds some starter code for an informal code review. 

You and your partner will fork this repository and then clone it on your own machines. Make sure that you add me as a collaborator to the forked repo (my GitHub username is markm208).

## main.cpp
The one file that is included holds a ```main()``` function and some stubs for the required functions. 

The functions need to be completed by you and your partner. You are welcome to write all of the code (including any new helper functions) in this one file, or you may add new files if you'd like. Discuss this with your partner before starting your work.

All that I require is that I am able to compile and run the code from the terminal by issuing this command:

```
g++ -o  main -std=c++20 *.cpp
```

This will generate an executable named ```main``` that is created from all of the source files (```.cpp```) in the top level of the repo. I have added the name of that executable to the ```.gitignore``` file. 

You are welcome to use an IDE for writing and testing your code. Recall that one way to do this is to have an IDE project folder that refers to the code in a repo. If you need help setting this up please see me ASAP.

Do not delay on getting started. Working in groups tends to be more difficult than you think when first starting out. 

Also, if you don't understand the requirements, please seek help immediately. I am happy to explain what I am looking for to you and your partner.
